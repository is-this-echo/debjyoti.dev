I am Arjun Nemani, a computer science student at IIIT-H and this is my personal blog.

I have been thinking about writing about my technical exploits for a long time.

The thought started out as a desire to emulate my role models, but it has grown a lot.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;">
  <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3oEjHWbXcpeKhTktXi"
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

I now think that having a technical blog is essential for a person like me â€” someone who eats, breaths and sleeps tech.

I feel that writing about your work allows you to think deeply and formalize the teachings of each day. Also, it is a great way of showcasing projects in depth.

This will be a place for me to share my ideas, projects, and learnings from my various pursuits.
While being mostly technical I will also share what I learned from organizing various events.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of self-discovery and technology.
