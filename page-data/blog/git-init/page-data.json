Through this blog, I want to create a space where I can openly express my thoughts and discoveries in a relatable way. You can expect a mix of personal experiences, lessons learned, and maybe even a few funny anecdotes along the way.\n<p>I feel that writing blog on literally anything- projects, events, experiences can be rewarding as it helps to revision the entire thing, focus on nitty gritty stuff, simulate deep thinking and inculcate\na sense of introspection and self-reflection.</p>\n<p>So, buckle up and join me on this journey as we dive into the fascinating world of technology, and explore how it shapes our lives, one post at a time!\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"git init && git add 'First blog post'","description":"hello world","date":"2022-01-12","slug":"/blog/git-init","tags":["Talk","Misc"]}}},"pageContext":{}}}
